								<p>My name is Adam I am 27 years old from Sydney, Australia. I am born and bred in Sydney and have never lived anywhere else. 
								In saying that I do like to travel and have visited 22 countries as of 2020. One of the most interesting places I have been was the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine in 2018.
								I have had no formal education since leaving high-school but have learnt a lot by jumping straight into the full time workforce at age 17.<p>

								<p>I have always been fascinated by IT since I was young. 
								Growing up as a child as the internet became the norm in everyone’s home meant new technologies were being developed constantly.
								As everything in life becomes more dependent on technology the need to be able to troubleshoot and fix issues with it increases. 
								I’ve always taken a liking to being able to fix problems myself and setting up different technologies in my own home or friend’s & families homes.
								I’m hoping that my studies will be able to help me turn my hobby like interest in IT into a complete career. RMIT offered the course I wanted and in a way that suits my current lifestyle and commitments the most.</p>

								<p><b>Description:</b> A system administrator within a company that has a client based focus. Being the system admin means taking care of client’s on site servers and desktop functions as well as providing help desk support for any issues that arise. Fixing and maintaining both software and hardware issues within Windows systems.
								This role appeals to me as it has a focus on analytical thinking and problem solving to achieve results. Understanding and then fixing problems in the IT world is what I find the most interesting. <p>
								<p><b>Requirements:</b> The job has specific requirements into several types of Windows/Microsoft systems. Including but not limited to Windows 7/8/10 and Office from 2010 onwards. Networking and server knowledge is required using programs like WSUS (Windows Server Update Services) to apply and distribute the necessary Microsoft updates to clients.<p>
								<p><b>Skills:</b> I don’t have any of the skills or qualifications listed in the job advertisement but I do have some related experience. The experience I have is from my time working as an AV technician in a large scale capacity on corporate offices which were being constructed. A fundamental knowledge of the hardware behind server racking, switches and understanding line diagrams of the networks was gained by working in the field. Understanding the basics of how the network was built physically in the first place should help when learning more about server configurations and networking.<p>
								<p><b>Obtaining:</b> A full Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology from RMIT. Utilising the electives within the degree as well as the future core subjects will provide me with the knowledge to be an effective system administrator. Within my current role in the Public Service there are technical roles which will become available to me throughout my degree which will act as hand on learning tool to complement my degree.<p>

								<p>The results of the above mentioned tests are not of a complete surprise to me. The “Myer-Briggs” style test has me listed as a virtuoso tagged as wanting to explore and always seeking improvement. The categorised sections has me pretty consistent down the middle in all parts. The learning style quiz shows that I am a visual learner. This is true to the fact that if I see something in practice with my eyes I will be able to recall easier then if it was something I simply read. The numeric psychometric test returned a result of 85%.
									Whilst working in a group environment wanting to improve yourself and the group’s goal is a positive. Learning things mainly by visual means can mean that having a team member who can get the ball rolling will be an advantage for myself. Numeracy is my main strength which whilst working on group IT projects will be a positive.</p>

								<p><b>Overview:</b> A simple idea for an app designed through MIT App Inventor which operates as a payment reminder system for upcoming bills, invoices or user input future payments of any kind. The app will operate on smartphones and will allow user’s to plan and control their finances to avoid paying extra by not having all upcoming payments collated into one digital calendar system.</p>

								<p><b>Motivation:</b> Where credit scores are becoming more important the need to pay bills, credit cards, loans and other forms of debt on time is something that a user should intend to do. Having a combination of letter bills, email bills and direct debits can easily lead to mismanagement of money owed resulting in unnecessary interest and or late fees. The ability to combine all different billing systems into one easy to manage notification system on a smartphone with ease can reduce all these unnecessary costs for the user.</p>
								<p><b>Description:</b> A user will be given different ways of entering bills, payments, etc. into the app. Data will be able to be manually entered. Requiring a title of the payment, how much the payment is, what date the payment is due and an option to create it as a recurring payment of the amount on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis.</p>
								<p>For physical paper invoices data will be captured by allowing the app access to the user’s smartphone camera with a single photo will be taken. Once the single photo is taken, using optical character recognition software, data will auto input into the payment total and payment due date fields. The user will then add a desired title and again allowing for the option to create a recurring notification.</p>
								<p>For bills and invoices which are sent electronically commonly in PDF format. A screenshot of the bill or invoice can be taken with the app. Then using user permitted access to the gallery selecting the photo and character recognition software operating and inputting data in the same way as when the smartphone’s camera is used.</p>
								<p>Users can adjust the time that a notification is received about an upcoming payment. This can be done at the time the payment is input or manually changed at a later date. Notifications can be set to remind the user from a set amount of days before due date or a specific user input date. The physical notification is a sticky banner on the lock screen of a user’s smartphone which can be cleared by the user. A badge icon on the app on the phone’s home screen will indicate to the user how many payments need to be actioned in the app. The badge will be removed when the user opens the app and is prompted to either say that a payment has been made or to re-schedule the time of the payment and notification time.</p>
								<p>A calendar section which can be scrolled through in month by month will allow users to properly forecast upcoming payments. If a user has recurring payments along with one off payments which have been put in they will able to select two different dates on the calendar and project how much money is owed during that period. </p>
								<p><b>Tools and Technologies:</b> App will be developed using MIT App Inventor. For the character recognition software using an open source program called Tesseract will be used. App will be designed to operate on android an iOS devices. The app does not require any physical hardware in the creation and production of it and should be achievable with no financial input.</p>
								<p><b>Skills Required:</b> Programming knowledge in the Java language will be required as it the programming language used in the building blocks for the app through the MIT App Inventor. The ability to integrate the character recognition software into the app will be a challenge and will require skills in understanding the Tesseract program and the MIT App Inventor to make it possible. The skills can be reasonably acquired by attempting to build the app and learning through tutorials provided by MIT and through actual use of the program itself.</p>
								<p><b>Outcome:</b> This is a simple and easy concept for people to use. The aim of the project is not to monetise it in anyway but to simply allow uses an easier to manage their finances and reduce the amount of unnecessary interest and fees which are constantly paid by forgetting when bills are due. People’s smartphones are almost always only an arm’s length away meaning they are the best place to have notifications and reminders about things that are important in your life, like keeping on top of your finances.</p>
